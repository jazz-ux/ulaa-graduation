        <h2>Dear Ulaa,</h2>
        <p>
          Today is your graduation — a milestone of dreams, sweat, late nights, and little victories.  
          I know I can’t be there with you, but I want this little page to feel like a whisper from me to your heart. I wasn’t there for every step, but I saw you —  
    in the way you kept going when everything felt heavy,  
    in the way you smiled even when your heart was tired.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ve always been more than just a girl with dreams — you’re the dream itself.  
          Your smile, your kindness, your strength — they light up every moment we share.  
          And as you step into this next chapter, I just want you to know:  
          <strong>  I know the road ahead won’t always be easy — but I also know *you*.  
    You’re not just going to survive the future, Ulaa — you’re going to own it.  
    You’ll walk into rooms that once felt too big, and they’ll shrink to fit your brilliance.You make me proud in ways I can’t even explain.</strong>
        </p>
        <p> And as you rise — I’ll be there.  
    Maybe not right beside you yet… but always one heartbeat away, dreaming of the day we build our mornings together,  
    wake up to the same sun, the same bed, the same life — yours and mine, finally intertwined.</p>
        <p>
          I’ll be here always — cheering for you, loving you, waiting for the day we explore the world together.  
          Until then, I’m sending you all my love through this page.
        </p>
        <p class="signature">Forever yours,<br />Zee</p>

  <h2>Our Journey</h2>
  <p>
    It all started with a message — a few words, a spark, a stranger’s voice that felt like home.  
    From that moment, something quiet and beautiful began to grow between us.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’ve loved each other across time zones, through screens, and despite the distance.  
    Every late-night laugh, every whispered dream, every soft goodbye — they’ve built something unbreakable.
  </p>
  <p>
    You’ve become my safe place, my rhythm, my reason.  
    And one day soon, this distance will melt into morning coffee and shared sunsets.  
    We’ll decorate a little home with photos like these and live the life we always dreamed of — together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Until then, I carry you in every heartbeat.  
    This page is just a glimpse of what you mean to me.
